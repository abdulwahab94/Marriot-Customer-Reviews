            "This hotel exuded a premium atmosphere with courteous staff and a generally positive first impression. However, my stay was marred by a couple of significant drawbacks.The room I was assigned had multiple brown stains on the carpet, which appeared to be coffee. When I reported this to guest services, the representative was very apologetic and offered me a choice of two alternative rooms. Unfortunately, both of these rooms also had similar stains on the carpet.Additionally, the water pressure in the shower was surprisingly weak, which did not meet my expectations for a premium hotel. Given the £190 per night rate, I was disappointed to encounter these issues.Despite the hotel's plush ambiance and pleasant staff, the stained carpets and weak shower pressure significantly detracted from my stay. Due to these factors, I am unlikely to recommend Courtyard By Marriott in Inverness to others.\n",

            "I made a pre-paid booking at AC hotel by Marriott in Boston on 1/27/24 since I missed the last train back to NY after a meeting with the CEO of Hancock. I live in Europe and where contactless payment is the norm, but at checkin the lady at the front desk would not accept contactless for the incidents only (the room was already paid).  I offered to pay the 250 deposit with cash, which she still refused.  She was acting annoyed, but I started to be nervous so I told her then I’ll sit in the lobby all night .  To thus she responded by threatening to call security to get me out.  So at freezing temperatures 11 at night she throws me out.  I walked around for two hours from hotel to hotel but while much mire helpful than her, no luck.  I ended up having to sleep at a hostel sharing room with 3 others.  The fact that she couldn’t even this one time take cash for the deposit and rather wanted a 60 year old man sleep in the street (which I though would be the case for awhile) is mind boggling.  Hence my 1 star review of this hotel.\n",

            "Just left the St.Pancras Renaissance Marriott Bonvoy hotel after a 3 day, 2 nights stay.With such heavily priced, room rates you'd want a higher level of service.  Not all staff are at a hospitality level deserved for charging these astronomic prices .. like £9 for a small white wine, £5 for mini pot of chips, £122 for a small dinner for two...  In the Spa, £140 for an hour massage... £160 for two half hour treatments (which were finished in 55 minutes and not particularly any good - low energy from the therapist) ... I found a number of the food and beverage staff to be curt, non smiling and unhelpful.  Not all, some were lovely but it felt majority were cold and brittle.  This could be an indicator of them being highly worked and low paid.  Very unfair because this Marriott company are obviously charging giant amounts of money.  Rooms were clean as was the Spa, products were good quality.  Many housekeeping were unable to understand English although they did try to assist to their best ability. I will hesitate in visiting this hotel/spa ever again.  It's not all bad but for prices charged, should be way better and feel staff should be better paid to help lift all spirits.\n",

            "Where do I begin... Reservation number: M1679860675804. I have been a titanium elite member for several years. I have generally received good service and usually felt appreciated because of my loyalty. However over the last year or so Marriott / Bonvoy has taken quite a turn. I have had a few questionable stays this year but the incident that has me questioning whether or not I want to continue my relationship with Marriott began in March 2023 when I reserved a house with Homes and Villas. It's Marriott version of AirB&B. In fact the home I rented was listed on both Air B&B and VRBO for less money but I chose to stay with Marriott because I trusted their service. I arranged the stay through my Bonvoy App including paying for the house. So, skip to yesterday, July 22, 2023, when I was contacted by a third party company, not Marriott requesting a credit card number for incidentals, the day before check in on July 23, 2023. I called the associated telephone number and reached someone with strong indicators of not being in this country based on very strong accent and their unwillingness to admit what country they were located in. I can also hear all the kids in the background. I was obviously concerned about giving them a credit card number with all of the concerns out there with identity theft. They transferred me to a woman calling herself Odessa. She demanded a credit card number or I would not be provided an access code to the house or access to the gated community that the house is located. I obviously contacted Bonvoy for assistance because this is where I made the reservation. I actually called and talked to about 10 representatives throughout the day. One of which told me I would be contacted directly by Homes and Villas on the same date. I was not so I called back and learned that everyone from Homes and Villas had gone home. Did I mention I was on the road traveling across country with my family? I learned that Homes and Villas has no customer service contacts except for the email and a worthless contact us app. I never received an email response from Homes and Villas and the contact app simply referred me back to the third party company who was extorting me for credit card info and more money. I wound up buying a loadable card from Walmart to pay the $250 incidental reserve. The third party app promptly charged me $896... I then made additional calls to Bonvoy who has done nothing by provide me excuses about why they cannot help. \"This is Bonvoy, not Homes and Villas\" \"You have to contact Homes and Villas\" \"They usually respond in five business days,\" If you recall, today is check in day... In total I spoke to two Bonvoy supervisors who said they escalated my complaint but still no contact. I spoke to maybe eight or ten representatives with no resolution. I then called the third party company who would not put me on with the representative who manages the rented property. I called Bonvoy to at least register this complaint and again, \"I apologize but I have no course to help you.\" I cannot believe the lack of service that I have received from Marriott. I have never been so disappointed in this company. Below are guarantees that Marriott Homes and Villas list on their own site:\"Worry-Free TravelTravel lighter with 24/7 support, seamless arrivals, and premium home essentials\"This is clearly BS! Marriott has resorted to leaving their customers vulnerable to the scammers they have decided to work with.\n",
